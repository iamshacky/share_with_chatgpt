Problem when visiting a site after it has been idle for a while. The first load time takes forever, but after that everything works fine.

### Possible alternate search terms
cold startup time for server
application pool timeout
initial server response time wordpress
first byte time
latency

### Possible reasons
SQL server bottleneck
Some hosts do throttle speeds for inactive pages

### Possible solutions
1). Create a cron job to call your home page once every 5, 10, or 20 minutes, to keep it "awake" so that you wonï¿½t have the issue of WordPress being slow to load the first page.

2). For Wordpress, see youtube title: How To Disable The WordPress Cron & Replace With A Real Cron Job - A Must For All Ecommerce Websites youtube url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQOs9PMJ4nY

Also see the cron jobs folder.


### WordPress Cron?
All Wordpress cron jobs are handled by WP-Cron.

### Ways to summarize the problem in a forum
Leave the site for a period, with no activity, and it takes an excessive amount of time to load the first page. Subsequent pages load fast.
